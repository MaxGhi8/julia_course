Here I upload all the material regarding the Julia course, Pavia a.y. 2024/25.

# Diary of the course:
1) In the first lesson we have seen the basics of Julia, how to install it and how to use it. In particular, we have seen the following chapter of the [official manual documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/): `Getting started`, `Installation`, `Variables`, `Integers and Floating-point numbers`, `Mathematical operations and elementary functions`, `Complex and rational numbers`. The first lecture was recorded and can be found [here](https://youtu.be/DTzxh3jyoAI?si=hRxoLNePhH6XpBlc).

2) In the second lesson we have seen the following chapter of the official manual documentation: `Strings`, `Functions`, `Control flow`. The we have seen some exercises on the topics covered in the first two lessons using the [official website](https://exercism.org/tracks/julia). In particular, we have seen the exercises `hello-world`, `Darts`, `Difference of squares`, `Collantz`. The solutions of these exercise and many others can be found in the folder `exercises`.

3) In the third lesson we setup a coding session and continue to see the exercises on the topics covered in the first two lessons to gain fluency and confidence in the use of Julia. In particular, we have seen the exercises `Raindrops`, `Grains`, `Acronym`, `Is pangram`, `nucleotide-count` and `Largest series product`. The solutions of these exercise and many others can be found in the folder `exercises`.

4) In the first part of fourth lesson we have continued to see some theory, in particular we cover `Scope of variables` and `Types`. In the second part we have applied this knowledge implementing finite difference for the poisson equation in one dimension setting.
